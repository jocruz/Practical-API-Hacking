# ðŸ“Œ High-Level Summary

This lab demonstrates how to identify and exploit SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities using **error-based techniques**, **Union Select attacks**, and automation tools like **ffuf** and **sqlmap**. By leveraging these methods, sensitive data like usernames and passwords can be extracted from the database.

# ðŸŽ¯ What to Look Out For During Testing

1. **Error Messages:**
    
    - Inject simple payloads like `'` to reveal database errors and confirm SQLi vulnerability.
    - Look for errors exposing database type (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
2. **Union Select Vulnerability:**
    
    - Determine the number of columns in the query by incrementally testing payloads like:
        
        ```sql
        UNION SELECT null, null, null
        ```
        
    - Match column order to the query structure to extract data.
3. **Automation Tools:**
    
    - Use **ffuf** with SQLi payload wordlists to fuzz parameters.
    - Utilize **sqlmap** for automated discovery, exploitation, and data extraction.
4. **Identify Key Parameters:**
    
    - Focus on parameters in GET or POST requests that interact with the database (e.g., `id`, `search`, `roast`).

# âœ… Key Steps for SQL Injection Testing

1. **Test for Errors:**
    
    - Start with simple payloads (`'`, `"`, `OR 1=1--`) to identify vulnerable inputs.
2. **Use Union Select:**
    
    - Extract data by crafting payloads that align with the queryâ€™s column count and structure.
3. **Automate with Tools:**
    
    - **ffuf:** Test multiple payloads quickly to identify injection points.
    - **sqlmap:** Automate database exploration and data extraction with flags like `--dump` to retrieve database contents.
4. **Verify and Exploit:**
    
    - Confirm findings manually using tools like Burp Suite to replicate the attack and ensure accuracy.

By following these methods, you can efficiently discover and exploit SQLi vulnerabilities in web applications.
