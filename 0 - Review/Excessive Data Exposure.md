# ðŸ“Œ High-Level Summary: Excessive Data Exposure

Excessive Data Exposure occurs when a web application unintentionally provides more data than necessary to users or endpoints. This vulnerability arises when sensitive data is sent from the backend to the frontend without proper filtering, leaving it exposed to attackers who can inspect raw API responses.

# ðŸŽ¯ What to Look Out For During Testing

1. **Unnecessary Fields in API Responses:**
    
    - Look for sensitive fields like `email`, `password hash`, `SSN`, `draft` statuses, or internal metadata.
2. **Trust on the Frontend:**
    
    - Check if sensitive data is included in responses but hidden by the frontend (e.g., JavaScript or CSS).
3. **Affected Endpoints:**
    
    - Test endpoints that return bulk data (e.g., `/api/posts`, `/api/users`, `/get-recent-posts`).
4. **Testing Tools:**
    
    - Use **Postman** or **Burp Suite** to analyze raw responses and identify excessive data.

# âœ… Key Steps for Testing

1. **Intercept API Responses:**
    
    - Use tools like Postman, Burp Suite, or browser DevTools to view complete server responses.
2. **Inspect for Sensitive Data:**
    
    - Look for fields that arenâ€™t displayed in the UI but are present in the raw response (e.g., `email`, `draft`, or private metadata).
3. **Manipulate API Calls:**
    
    - Test endpoints by changing parameters or user roles to see if additional sensitive data is exposed.
4. **Analyze Patterns:**
    
    - Compare what the user sees on the frontend versus the raw API response to identify discrepancies.

# âœ… Key Takeaways

- **Mitigations for Excessive Data Exposure:**
    
    1. **Backend Filtering:** Ensure the backend sends only the required data to the client.
    2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Restrict access to sensitive fields based on user roles.
    3. **Endpoint Audits:** Regularly review API endpoints for unnecessary fields.
    4. **Penetration Testing:** Use tools like Burp Suite to identify data exposure vulnerabilities.
- **Core Principle:** Never trust the frontend to filter data. The backend must strictly control and limit the data it exposes to reduce the risk of sensitive information leakage.
