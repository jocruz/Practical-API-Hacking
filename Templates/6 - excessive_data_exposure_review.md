# üõ°Ô∏è Excessive Data Exposure Review

## üß≠ High-Level Summary
Excessive Data Exposure occurs when an API or web application exposes more data than necessary, often without implementing proper filtering or masking mechanisms. This vulnerability can lead to sensitive information disclosure, putting user privacy and application security at risk.

## üìö Definitions and Key Terms
| **Term**                | **Definition**                                                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Excessive Data Exposure** | Revealing more data than necessary in API responses or web interfaces. |
| **Data Filtering**       | Restricting visible fields to only what is required.                 |
| **Data Masking**         | Obscuring sensitive information such as PII or financial data.      |
| **Sensitive Data**       | Information like SSNs, credit card numbers, or medical records.     |
| **API Endpoint**         | A specific route in an API where requests are processed.            |

## üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Excessive Data Exposure
**Steps**:
1. **Inspect API Responses**:
   - Use tools like **Postman** or **Burp Suite** to analyze responses.
   - Look for fields like `SSN`, `password`, `creditCardNumber`, etc.
2. **Review Documentation**:
   - Compare actual responses with the API documentation to identify unnecessary fields.
3. **Test Different Roles**:
   - Ensure role-based access controls are implemented to restrict data visibility.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploiting Excessive Data Exposure
**Steps**:
1. Use valid API tokens to access endpoints.
2. Analyze responses for sensitive or unexpected fields.
3. Test for missing filtering mechanisms by manipulating parameters or headers.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Mitigation Strategies
- Implement **whitelisting** of data fields to explicitly allow only necessary data.
- Use **output encoding** to prevent sensitive data leaks.
- Apply **role-based access control (RBAC)** to enforce data access restrictions.

## üìå Key Takeaways and Tools

### Tools
- **Burp Suite**: For intercepting and analyzing API traffic.
- **Postman**: For sending and inspecting API requests.
- **Fiddler**: For monitoring HTTP traffic.
- **Security Headers**: To implement policies restricting data exposure.

### Key Takeaways
- APIs should only expose data necessary for the operation.
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in client-side responses.
- Regularly review API responses to ensure compliance with privacy standards.
